## Warm-up exercises with garden data

These exercises will reiterate what you learned in the "Expanding the data wrangling toolkit" tutorial. If you haven't gone through the tutorial yet, you should do that first.

  1. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest weight in pounds for each vegetable and day of week (HINT: use the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Display the results so that the vegetables are rows but the days of the week are columns.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(wt_lb = weight * 0.00220462,
         day = wday(date, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, day) %>% 
  summarise(total = sum(wt_lb)) %>% 
  pivot_wider(id_cols = vegetable,
              names_from = day,
              values_from = total)
```

  2. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest in pound for each vegetable variety and then try adding the plot from the `garden_planting` table. This will not turn out perfectly. What is the problem? How might you fix it?

```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(wt_lb = weight * 0.00220462) %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, variety) %>% 
  summarise(total_lb = sum(wt_lb)) %>% 
  left_join(garden_planting,
            by = c("vegetable", "variety"))
```

> Some varieties might not have plot information available and some might have multiple plots. One way to fix it is to only choose one of the plots, but this would lead to loss of some information.

  3. I would like to understand how much money I "saved" by gardening, for each vegetable type. Describe how I could use the `garden_harvest` and `garden_spending` datasets, along with data from somewhere like [this](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/search?sort=relevance&store=10542) to answer this question. You can answer this in words, referencing various join functions. You don't need R code but could provide some if it's helpful.

> For each vegetable, I would first sum up the total harvest in pound. Then, I would left join garden_harvest with the wholefoodsmarket and with the garden_spending datasets. Multiplying the total harvest in pound for each vegetable and the price ($ per pound), I would get a new variable, `total`, representing the amount needed to purchase the same amount of vegetables you have in the garden. The last step would be to subtract the price with tax variable from this new variable `total`- a positive number is the amount saved and a negative number is extra spending. The sum is how much money saved by gardening for each vegetable type.

  4. Subset the data to tomatoes. Reorder the tomato varieties from smallest to largest first harvest date. Create a barplot of total harvest in pounds for each variety, in the new order.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  filter(vegetable == "tomatoes") %>% 
  mutate(variety = fct_reorder(variety, date, min)) %>% 
  group_by(variety) %>%
  summarise(total_lb = sum(weight * 0.00220462)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = total_lb, y = variety)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(y = "tomato variety",
       x = "total harvest in pounds")
```

  5. In the `garden_harvest` data, create two new variables: one that makes the varieties lowercase and another that finds the length of the variety name. Arrange the data by vegetable and length of variety name (smallest to largest), with one row for each vegetable variety. HINT: use `str_to_lower()`, `str_length()`, and `distinct()`.
  
```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(variety_low = str_to_lower(variety),
         variety_length = str_length(variety)) %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, variety) %>% 
  arrange(vegetable, variety_length) %>% 
  distinct(vegetable, variety, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

  6. In the `garden_harvest` data, find all distinct vegetable varieties that have "er" or "ar" in their name. HINT: `str_detect()` with an "or" statement (use the | for "or") and `distinct()`.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  filter(str_detect(variety, "er") | str_detect(variety, "ar")) %>% 
  distinct(vegetable, variety, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

## Bicycle-Use Patterns

In this activity, you'll examine some factors that may influence the use of bicycles in a bike-renting program.  The data come from Washington, DC and cover the last quarter of 2014.

Two data tables are available:

- `Trips` contains records of individual rentals
- `Stations` gives the locations of the bike rental stations

Here is the code to read in the data. We do this a little differently than usualy, which is why it is included here rather than at the top of this file. To avoid repeatedly re-reading the files, start the data import chunk with `{r cache = TRUE}` rather than the usual `{r}`.

```{r cache=TRUE}
data_site <- 
  "https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data.rds" 
Trips <- readRDS(gzcon(url(data_site)))
Stations<-read_csv("http://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/DC-Stations.csv")
```

**NOTE:** The `Trips` data table is a random subset of 10,000 trips from the full quarterly data. Start with this small data table to develop your analysis commands. **When you have this working well, you should access the full data set of more than 600,000 events by removing `-Small` from the name of the `data_site`.**

### Temporal patterns

It's natural to expect that bikes are rented more at some times of day, some days of the week, some months of the year than others. The variable `sdate` gives the time (including the date) that the rental started. Make the following plots and interpret them:

  7. A density plot, which is a smoothed out histogram, of the events versus `sdate`. Use `geom_density()`.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sdate)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(x = "time (including the date) that the rental started")
```
  
  8. A density plot of the events versus time of day.  You can use `mutate()` with `lubridate`'s  `hour()` and `minute()` functions to extract the hour of the day and minute within the hour from `sdate`. Hint: A minute is 1/60 of an hour, so create a variable where 3:30 is 3.5 and 3:45 is 3.75.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(time = hour(sdate) + minute(sdate) / 60) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(x = "time of day")
```
  
  9. A bar graph of the events versus day of the week. Put day on the y-axis.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = day)) +
  geom_bar()
```
  
  10. Facet your graph from exercise 8. by day of the week. Is there a pattern?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(time = hour(sdate) + minute(sdate) / 60,
         day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +
  geom_density() +
  facet_wrap(~(day)) +
  labs(x = "time of day")
```

> There is a pattern on weekdays and one on weekend. On weekdays, there are two peaks at around 8am and 6pm. On weekends, most events are in the early afternoons.

The variable `client` describes whether the renter is a regular user (level `Registered`) or has not joined the bike-rental organization (`Causal`). The next set of exercises investigate whether these two different categories of users show different rental behavior and how `client` interacts with the patterns you found in the previous exercises. 

  11. Change the graph from exercise 10 to set the `fill` aesthetic for `geom_density()` to the `client` variable. You should also set `alpha = .5` for transparency and `color=NA` to suppress the outline of the density function.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(time = hour(sdate) + minute(sdate) / 60,
         day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = client), alpha = 0.5, color = NA) +
  facet_wrap(~(day)) +
  labs(x = "time of day")
```

  12. Change the previous graph by adding the argument `position = position_stack()` to `geom_density()`. In your opinion, is this better or worse in terms of telling a story? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(time = hour(sdate) + minute(sdate) / 60,
         day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = client), alpha = 0.5, color = NA, position = position_stack()) +
  facet_wrap(~(day)) +
  labs(x = "time of day")
```
  
> I think this is worse in terms of telling a story because it is harder to tell which client type has a higher density. However, this has the advantage of showing the total density at the same time.
  
  13. In this graph, go back to using the regular density plot (without `position = position_stack()`). Add a new variable to the dataset called `weekend` which will be "weekend" if the day is Saturday or Sunday and  "weekday" otherwise (HINT: use the `ifelse()` function and the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Then, update the graph from the previous problem by faceting on the new `weekend` variable. 
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(time = hour(sdate) + minute(sdate) / 60,
         day = wday(sdate),
         weekend = ifelse(day <= 5, "weekday", "weekend")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = client), alpha = 0.5, color = NA) +
  facet_wrap(~(weekend)) +
  labs(x = "time of day")
```
  
  14. Change the graph from the previous problem to facet on `client` and fill with `weekday`. What information does this graph tell you that the previous didn't? Is one graph better than the other?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(time = hour(sdate) + minute(sdate) / 60,
         day = wday(sdate),
         weekend = ifelse(day <= 5, "weekday", "weekend")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = weekend), alpha = 0.5, color = NA) +
  facet_wrap(~(client)) +
  labs(x = "time of day")
```
  
> This graph tells whether client type changes the pattern of how weekend or weekday affects the distribution of events. There is no one graph better than the other - it depends on what kind of questions the graph needs to answer.
  
### Spatial patterns

  15. Use the latitude and longitude variables in `Stations` to make a visualization of the total number of departures from each station in the `Trips` data. Use either color or size to show the variation in number of departures. We will improve this plot next week when we learn about maps!
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  left_join(Stations,
            by = c("sstation" = "name")) %>% 
  group_by(lat, long) %>%
  summarise(total_number_of_departures = n()) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = lat, y = long, size = total_number_of_departures)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  labs(x = "latitude", y = "longtitude")
```
  
  16. Only 14.4% of the trips in our data are carried out by casual users. Create a plot that shows which area(s) have stations with a much higher percentage of departures by casual users. What patterns do you notice? (Again, we'll improve this next week when we learn about maps).
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(client_num = ifelse(client == "Casual", 1, 0)) %>% 
  group_by(sstation) %>% 
  summarize(percentage_of_departures_by_casual_users = sum(client_num) / n()) %>% 
  left_join(Stations,
            by = c("sstation" = "name")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = lat, y = long, color = percentage_of_departures_by_casual_users)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .5) +
  labs(x = "latitude", y = "longtitude")
```
  
> There seems to be more casual users where not many stations are available, because light blue points are farther away from other points. There seems also to be more casual users where longtitude is closer to -77.2 and latitude is around 39.1

### Spatiotemporal patterns

  17. Make a table with the ten station-date combinations (e.g., 14th & V St., 2014-10-14) with the highest number of departures, sorted from most departures to fewest. Save this to a new dataset and print out the dataset. Hint: `as_date(sdate)` converts `sdate` from date-time format to date format. 
  
```{r}
new <- Trips %>% 
  mutate(date = as_date(sdate)) %>% 
  group_by(sstation, date) %>% 
  summarise(number_of_departures = n()) %>% 
  arrange(desc(number_of_departures)) %>% 
  head(10)

new
```
  
  18. Use a join operation to make a table with only those trips whose departures match those top ten station-date combinations from the previous part.
  
```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(sdate)) %>% 
  right_join(new,
            by = c("date", "sstation"))
```
  
  19. Build on the code from the previous problem (ie. copy that code below and then %>% into the next step.) and group the trips by client type and day of the week (use the name, not the number). Find the proportion of trips by day within each client type (ie. the proportions for all 7 days within each client type add up to 1). Display your results so day of week is a column and there is a column for each client type. Interpret your results.

```{r}
Trips %>%
  mutate(date = as_date(sdate)) %>% 
  right_join(new,
            by = c("date", "sstation")) %>% 
  mutate(day = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  group_by(client) %>% 
  mutate(total = n()) %>% 
  group_by(day, client) %>% 
  mutate(subtotal = n()) %>%
  summarise(perc = subtotal / total) %>% 
  distinct(day, client, .keep_all = TRUE) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = client,
              values_from = perc)
```

> During weekdays, the majority of the clients are registered; while the majority are casual during weekend.

## Challenge problem! 

This problem uses the data from the Tidy Tuesday competition this week, `kids`. If you need to refresh your memory on the data, read about it [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-15/readme.md). 

  21. In this exercise, you are going to try to replicate the graph below, created by Georgios Karamanis. I'm sure you can find the exact code on GitHub somewhere, but **DON'T DO THAT!** You will only be graded for putting an effort into this problem. So, give it a try and see how far you can get without doing too much googling. HINT: use `facet_geo()`. The graphic won't load below since it came from a location on my computer. So, you'll have to reference the original html on the moodle page to see it.
  
<!-- ![](kids_data_karamanis.jpeg) -->

```{r}
kids %>% 
  filter((year == 1997 | year == 2016) & variable == "lib") %>% 
  group_by(state, year) %>% 
  mutate(thousand = round(inf_adj_perchild * 1000)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = thousand)) +
  geom_line(arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.1,"cm")), color = "white") +
  facet_geo(~state) +
  labs(x = "",
       y = "",
       title = "Change in public spending on libraries from 1997 to 2016 \n Thousands of dollars spent perchild, adjusted for inflation",
       caption = "Source: Urban Institute | Graphic: Georgios Karamanis") +
  theme(panel.border = element_blank(), panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
